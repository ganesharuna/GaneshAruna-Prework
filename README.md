This project was designed to demonstrate what I learned during the dev10 coding bootcamp. Each assessment was designed to test and challenge your skills developed in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

The HTML and CSS assessment was designed to test the basic html and css skills covered in the lessons. This was done by recreating a html page from scratch using html and css and a basic understanding of elements, classes, and css design.

The next assessment was designed to test a more comprehensive understanding of CSS. Once again, the task required  recreating a HTML page from scratch, but this time using a greater depth of css knowledge such as the box model, relative file paths, and CSS positioning.

The last lesson assessment was designed to test a basic understanding of Bootstrap. The HTML page from the basic HTML and CSS assessment was recreated, but this time using bootstrap components and the bootstrap grid.

Finally, the module assessment comprehensively tested for HTML, CSS, and bootstrap skills by creating three HTML webpages. The first HTML page was a page describing the coder and required knowledge of navbars, footers, and floats. The second page was a contact html page that required a knowledge of forms. Finally, the last page was a portfolio page designed to test the programmers knowledge of cards, images, and bootstrap grids.

The second module was an introduction to javascript, utilization of variables, the console, arrays, loops, DOMs, functions, callbacks and events, and objects. However, the first assessment merely tested a basic understanding of javascript by asking the programmer to perform three tasks. The first task was to compute several expressions, the product of which were displayed in the console. The second activity asked for a conditional to test the length of a variable that was prompted by the script and alerted the programmer depending upon the length. The last task was to make an array and succesfully loop through the original array as well as a new one created by prompt.

Lastly, the final assessment was a comprehensive test of javascript. This assessment required a game of hangman to be made. Javascript was used to listen for keys pressed and looped through the master word character to check if the key was in the word. If it was, a series of underscores previously created would be updated to indicate that this letter was part of the word. If not, the letter is displayed as a incorrect guess. Either way, the game will reset after 8 incorrect guesses are made or the master word is guessed correctly, and wins are kept track of. To make it look nicer, a nba theme was picked, with basketball-themed font anda continously loop array of famous basketball images.
